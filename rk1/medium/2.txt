The concept of artificial intelligence (AI) has gained significant attention in recent years. AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and problem-solving. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. This technology has found applications in various industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. However, concerns about the ethical implications of AI, such as job displacement and privacy issues, have also been raised. As AI continues to advance, it is crucial to strike a balance between technological progress and societal well-being.
