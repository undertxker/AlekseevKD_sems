The phenomenon of quantum entanglement, which is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, has intrigued scientists for decades. It refers to the correlation between two or more particles that are separated by large distances, such that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the state of the other particles. This non-local connection challenges our classical understanding of cause and effect, as it suggests that information can be instantaneously transmitted between entangled particles, regardless of the distance between them. Numerous experiments have been conducted to study and harness this phenomenon for applications in quantum computing, cryptography, and teleportation. Despite its mysterious nature, quantum entanglement holds great promise for revolutionizing various fields of science and technology.
